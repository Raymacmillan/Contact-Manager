## Resources & Additional messages
Mainly used the Haskell textbook(Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!) as well as some google sources including chatgpt.
Made this project open source with the hope that someone out there will become inspired and be eager to learn haskell  
I have realised that Haskell is not popular programming language yet it's one language that is extremely powerful. I urge everyone to join me on raising awareness on how important it is to learn functional programming with this powerful language.  
Feel free to send me pull requests if there are any changes you would like to make to this project or rather, if you would like to contribute to this open source project.
